### Business Understanding
The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of the Kitaru website, focusing on visitor engagement, referral effectiveness, and geographical reach. Understanding these metrics is crucial for enhancing website content, optimizing marketing strategies, and improving user experience.

### Data Understanding
The dataset includes metrics such as visitor types (new vs. returning), referral sources (Referrals, Search Engine, Social Media), monthly visitor counts, the most visited pages, and the geographical distribution of visitors. The data captures visitor behavior and engagement over a specified period.

### Data Preparation
Data preparation was conducted using Python, which involved:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing any irrelevant data.
- Data Transformation: Aggregating data to monthly or categorical levels, deriving new features (e.g., visit duration), and formatting the data for easy visualization.
- Data Integration: Combining multiple data sources, such as referral sources and visitor types, into a cohesive dataset for analysis.
### Modeling
The visualizations in Power BI serve as descriptive models that provide insights into website performance.

### Evaluation
The evaluation phase involves assessing the visualizations to ensure they effectively convey the intended insights. This might include:

- Validity of Findings: Verifying that the trends and patterns observed align with expected outcomes.
- Business Impact: Assessing how these insights can inform strategic decisions, such as focusing on high-performing referral sources or targeting specific geographical regions for marketing.
### Deployment
The analysis is deployed through a Power BI dashboard, which allows stakeholders to interact with the data and derive ongoing insights. The dashboard facilitates continuous monitoring of key metrics, enabling data-driven decisions to improve website performance.

This structured approach using the CRISP-DM model helps ensure the analysis is comprehensive, actionable, and aligned with business objectives.
