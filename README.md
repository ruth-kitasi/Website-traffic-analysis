## Website traffic analysis.
### Business Understanding
The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of the Kitaru website, focusing on visitor engagement, referral effectiveness, and geographical reach. Understanding these metrics is crucial for enhancing website content, optimizing marketing strategies, and improving user experience.

### Data Understanding
The dataset includes metrics such as visitor types (new vs. returning), referral sources (Referrals, Search Engine, Social Media), monthly visitor counts, the most visited pages, and the geographical distribution of visitors. The data captures visitor behavior and engagement over a specified period.

### Data Preparation
Data preparation was conducted using Python, which involved:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing any irrelevant data.
- Data Transformation: Aggregating data to monthly or categorical levels, deriving new features (e.g., visit duration), and formatting the data for easy visualization.
- Data Integration: Combining multiple data sources, such as referral sources and visitor types, into a cohesive dataset for analysis.
### Modeling
The visualizations in Power BI serve as descriptive models that provide insights into website performance.

Key modeling techniques include:

### Trend Analysis: 
- Visualizing monthly visitors to identify seasonal patterns or trends.
There is a notable spike in visitors in January (2,765 visitors). Visitor numbers drop significantly from February to December, with the lowest number in December (115 visitors). This pattern indicates seasonality or the impact of a particular event or campaign in January

- Comparative Analysis: Comparing new vs. returning visitors to assess user retention.
There is a higher proportion of returning visitors (2,956) compared to new visitors (1,120). This suggests that the website has a strong base of repeat visitors

- Geographical Analysis: Mapping visitor locations to understand the global reach of the website.
The majority of visitors come from the United States (1,158 visitors), followed by Kenya (827 visitors).
The UK, India, and France also contribute to the traffic, though with significantly fewer visitors (ranging from 138 to 162).

### Evaluation
The evaluation phase involves assessing the visualizations to ensure they effectively convey the intended insights. This might include:

- Validity of Findings: Verifying that the trends and patterns observed align with expected outcomes.
- Business Impact: Assessing how these insights can inform strategic decisions, such as focusing on high-performing referral sources or targeting specific geographical regions for marketing.
### Deployment
The analysis is deployed through a Power BI dashboard, which allows stakeholders to interact with the data and derive ongoing insights. The dashboard facilitates continuous monitoring of key metrics, enabling data-driven decisions to improve website performance.

This structured approach using the CRISP-DM model helps ensure the analysis is comprehensive, actionable, and aligned with business objectives.
